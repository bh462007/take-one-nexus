## 📽️ The Vision

> **Nexus [nɛksəs]:** A connection or series of connections linking two or more things.

TAKE ONE Nexus is the definitive digital ecosystem for the next generation of filmmakers, screenwriters, and creative technocrats. 

**The Problem**: Student filmmakers and independent creatives often struggle to find dedicated, skilled crew members for their passion projects. Traditional networking is fragmented.

**The Solution**: A platform designed with a cinematic "Director-style" aesthetic that acts as a secure, real-time hub for showcasing portfolios, discovering talent based on creative roles, and forming production crews. 

---

## ⚡ Core Features

*   **👥 Communities**: Form, discover, and join specialized filmmaking groups and production units.
*   **📂 Crew Directory & Profiles**: Comprehensive index of creators sorted by roles (Directors, DPs, Editors, Writers, Photographers) with live cinematic portfolios serving as digital reels.
*   **👑 Role System & Management**: Fine-grained community roles (Owner, Admin, Member) with administrative workflows (member promotion, demotion, removal).
*   **📩 Invite & Request System**: Send join invitations or manage incoming join requests with dedicated approval dashboards.
*   **🏆 Live Leaderboard**: Real-time community ranking system based on creative engagement and verified creator achievements.
*   **🎬 Projects & Script Sharing**: Share scripts securely with built-in PDF iframe preview and options for monetization.
*   **🛡️ Authentication & Verification**: Secure stateless JWT sessions coupled with a full signup-to-verification email flow. Verified creators earn a neon (✦) verified badge.
*   **🛰️ Real-Time Chat & Notifications**: Real-time communication powered by Pusher. Direct messaging, group chats, live typing, and instant project notifications.
*   **📊 Observability & Analytics**: Integrated Graphifyy Analytics, PostHog telemetry (GDPR compliant), and Sentry error tracking for monitoring system health and engagement.
*   **✉️ Email Services**: Resend-powered automated onboarding, verification links, and script moderation reviews.
*   **💳 Payment Gateway**: Secure backend-verified Razorpay payment verification gating public script publication.
*   **🖥️ Admin Command Center**: Elevated dashboard for system telemetry, script moderation queues, and user triage.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern, scalable hybrid architecture.

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 16 (App Router), Vanilla HTML/CSS (Static UI), React 19 |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js |
| **Database** | MySQL (optimized for TiDB Cloud) |
| **ORM** | Prisma ORM |
| **Real-time** | Pusher (WebSockets) |
| **Authentication** | Stateless JWT stored in secure HTTP-only cookies |
| **Mailing** | Resend API & Nodemailer |
| **Analytics & Telemetry** | **Graphifyy** (Privacy-friendly), **PostHog** (User experience telemetry) |
| **Error Monitoring** | **Sentry** (Backend exceptions) |
| **Payments** | Razorpay (Signature-verified) |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (Hybrid Serverless & Static) |

For details, refer to [TECH_STACK.md](TECH_STACK.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

TAKE ONE Nexus utilizes a **dual-server architecture** running side-by-side on Vercel:
- **Next.js App (`src/app/`):** Handles dynamic authenticated routes (e.g., `/profile`, `/chat`, `/admin`), PostHog analytics, Sentry monitoring, and Graphifyy integration.
- **Express Server (`server.js`):** Acts as the API layer (`/api/*`), processes complex SQL queries securely, handles rate limiting, and serves high-performance static HTML files (`public/*.htm`).

### Subdomain Strategy
The Administrative Moderation Console is decoupled and hosted on the `admin` subdomain:
- **Main App**: `takeone-nexus.net.in` (Apex)
- **Admin Portal**: `admin.takeone-nexus.net.in` (Subdomain)
- **Shared Session**: Auth cookies share a common apex domain configuration: `domain: '.takeone-nexus.net.in'`. Users with the appropriate `secondary_role` permissions (e.g. `Admin`) can navigate to the admin console without re-authenticating.

For details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: v18+
- **Database**: MySQL / TiDB instance
- **Pusher**: Account for real-time WebSockets
- **Resend**: API key for transactional emails
- **Graphifyy**: Analytics tracking key (optional)
- **PostHog**: API key for local analytics tracking (optional)
- **Sentry**: DSN for error monitoring (optional)
- **Git**: For version control

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alokr25012-lab/take-one-nexus.git
cd take-one-nexus
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on `.env.example`:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@host:port/database"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your_secure_secret_min_32_chars"

# Real-time Chat (Pusher)
PUSHER_APP_ID="your_app_id"
PUSHER_SECRET="your_secret"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_KEY="your_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSHER_CLUSTER="your_cluster"

# Email Automation (Resend)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_key"

# Observability (PostHog & Sentry)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY="phc_your_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST="https://eu.i.posthog.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="https://your_dsn@sentry.io/project"

# Local Development API Proxy
LEGACY_API_ORIGIN="http://127.0.0.1:5001"
```

### 4. Database Setup

Initialize your database schema using Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

Alternatively, you can initialize and seed the raw database tables and test accounts (password for all: `password123`) using our dedicated scripts:

```bash
# Create database schema tables
npm run db:init

# Seed the database with creative profiles and sample scripts
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Start Local Development

Because of the hybrid architecture, run the Next.js dev server (which proxies API requests to Express):

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a separate terminal, run the Express backend:

```bash
npm run legacy:dev
```

The platform should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 🚢 Production Deployment

TAKE ONE Nexus is optimized for deployment on **Vercel**.

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Configure the environment variables in the Vercel Dashboard.
3. Vercel will use the `vercel.json` file to handle complex routing between Next.js and the Express backend automatically.
4. The build command is pre-configured to `npm run build` which runs `prisma generate && next build`.
